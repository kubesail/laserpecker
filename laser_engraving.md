# Laser Engraving Tips & Tricks

## Safety

Never ever look at the laser when it's engraving with naked eyes. Do not stare at the laser when it's engraving even with eye protections. It's OK to look at the laser in preview mode. It's low power. I know it's hard to resist watching the ongoing engraving job, we have all done it... If you must watch it for whatever reason, point your phone's camera to it through some laser protection and watch over the phone screen.

If you wish to purchase your own laser protections, make sure they protect against 405-450nm laser.

In addition to eye protection, protect yourself from toxic fumes from laser engraving, especially when engraving any sort of plastic or paint. Although the fumes/smoke could potentially harm or kill you, all you need is good ventilation to stay safe. If the weather and space allow it, do your engravings outside (portable laser engraver FTW!). If you must do it indoors, try to stay near your window (and have a small fan to blow the smoke out if possible), or under your kitchen extractor hood, or in your bathroom with ventilation fan on, or in your workstation with a proper ventilation/air filtering system.



## Baking Soda Magic (on wood and fabric)

This is not rocket science, and the ratio does not have to be exact - mix **1 tea spoon** full of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) in **half cup** of water. That's it. Apply a thin coating of baking soda solution on your wood or fabric with a brush, spray or just your finger; let it dry before engraving. The solution does not go off, so you can keep it for future use.

Baking soda helps browning of wood and fabric when lasered, so that the treated material requires much lower setting (e.g. half the normal depth, which also means a lot faster) to engrave and gives better results.

Here are some tests of mine on wood and cardboard:

## Dithering

Dithering an image means to use different densities of black and white pixels to emulate grayscale. The end goal is to use Bin mode (B&W) to engrave (or print) something that appears in grayscale. (more to come)
