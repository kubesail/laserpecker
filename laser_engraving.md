# Laser Engraving Tips & Tricks

## Baking Soda Magic (on wood and fabric)

This is not rocket science, and the ratio does not have to be exact - mix **1 tea spoon** full of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) in **half cup** of water. That's it. Apply a thin coating of baking soda solution on your wood or fabric with a brush, spray or just your finger; let it dry before engraving. The solution does not go off, so you can keep it for future use.

Baking soda helps browning of wood and fabric when lasered, so that the treated material requires much lower setting (e.g. half the normal depth, which also means a lot faster) to engrave and gives better results.
