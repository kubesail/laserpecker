# Unofficial Guide to LaserPecker Laser Engravers

I am a happy owner of LaserPecker L1, L1 Pro and LP2. Here I document some of my usage and experience of using them. I may refer to L1 Pro as Pro for short in the rest of the articles.

Please note that my methods and settings are not necessarily the best. I have never used any laser engraver before, and these are the only ones I have for hobby use. I'll try to update my articles as I learn new tricks and test new materials.
